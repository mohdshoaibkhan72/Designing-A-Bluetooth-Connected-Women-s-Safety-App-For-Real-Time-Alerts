## Abstract

This study introduces a safety app for women, focusing on using Bluetooth to enhance security. The app, designed for smartphones, connects with a Bluetooth device. If the connection is lost, it sends a distress message to the user’s parents immediately, ensuring prompt assistance. The research explains the app’s functionality, setup, and response in case of a problem. It emphasizes the importance of such apps for women’s safety, providing peace of mind and swift help in emergencies. The paper discusses potential improvements and the broader societal impact, highlighting technology’s crucial role in enhancing women’s safety and addressing safety concerns through innovation.

## Features

- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Monitors the connection between the smartphone and a wearable device.
- **Distress Signal**: Automatically sends a distress message if the Bluetooth connection is lost.
- **Location Tracking**: Sends the user’s location to emergency contacts.
- **User Verification**: Includes a 10-second alert for the user to verify their safety by entering a code.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Notifies predefined emergency contacts if the user fails to verify their safety.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of GPS tracking, voice recognition, and real-time audio/video streaming.
- Development of advanced wearable devices with sensors to detect various safety threats.
